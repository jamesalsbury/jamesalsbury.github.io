subtitle: Assurance Methods for Adaptive Clinical Trials

My PhD project combines two different notions from clinical trials: assurance and being adaptive.

Assurance methods are becomming increasisly popular when planniung clinical trials. Assurance methods work by specfying prior distributions for the parameters in the trial (the treatment effect, for example).
