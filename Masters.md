# Scores on the Doors

For my Masters' Dissertation at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/) I looked at Food Hygiene Ratings across the UK. Specifically, I looked to see whether they were randomly scattered around the country or if there were geospatial trends. If there were trends, what were the main factors that influenced these trends? [View my Thesis here](documents/JamesSalsbury-MMathStat.pdf). Comments and errata are always welcome!

I created a Shiny App as part of my project, which allows users to browse a map of England with the option to view food establishments by postcode districts. The app can be found [here](https://jamesalsbury.shinyapps.io/interactiveshinymap/).

I also created an A0 poster for submission for my project. [View my poster here](documents/JamesSalsbury_MMathStat_Poster.pdf).
