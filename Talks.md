## June 2022 - [PSI Conference 2022](https://psiweb.org/conferences/about-the-conference)

One of my supervisors, [Jeremy Oakley](http://www.jeremy-oakley.staff.shef.ac.uk/), was invited to the PSI Conference to talk about his 2020 [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.2040). Unfortunately, he was not able to attend, so I went in his place. Therefore, one-third of the talk discussed assurance methods - some of the barriers to using assurance in practice and how to overcome them. One-third discussed Jeremy's paper and the last third was my current research. [View my talk here.](documents/PSI Conference 2022 Presentation - James Salsbury.pdf)
